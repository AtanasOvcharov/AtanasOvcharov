## Hi, I'am Atanas 👋
Electronics & embedded-systems student at a technical university in Bulgaria — I design and program electronic systems (firmware + PCB prototypes). I do a bit of professional work as I learn, I love programming, and I’m also a big football fan ⚽.

## 🧠 Skills & Focus

**Hardware & Design**  
- 🧩 **Altium Designer** – experience creating schematics and PCB layouts (analog + digital).  
- ⚡ **Electronics fundamentals** – deep interest and hands-on practice with circuit design, debugging, and prototyping.  

**Firmware & Programming (Growing)**  
- 💻 **Embedded C** – building firmware for microcontrollers (STM32)   
- 🐍 **Python (Beginner)** – using it for small automation scripts, serial communication, and data visualization.  

**Currently Learning**  
- 📐 Advanced PCB design techniques (signal integrity, EMC).  
- ⏱️ Firmware architecture and real-time programming concepts (RTOS, modular code).  
- 🔗 Better integration between hardware and firmware workflows.
